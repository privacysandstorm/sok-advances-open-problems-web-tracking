\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Online tracking has a vast literature, comprising numerous research studies published over the last few decades.
%
As a result, we first carry out a literature survey to identify all papers related to web tracking published in the last 20 years (2005 onward) at any of the seven top web security and privacy venues---IEEE S\&P, USENIX Security, ACM CCS, NDSS, ACM IMC, PETS, and WWW.
%
A total of 200+ research papers were identified. 
%
Each paper was assigned one or more topics related to web tracking based on the abstract of the paper.
%
The assignment of topics was jointly performed by two researchers following Clarke and Braunâ€™s~\cite{clarke2013successful} thematic analysis approach.
%
A total of 84 topical themes were identified, with the top 15 (by number of papers) being tracking measurement, third-party tracking, browser fingerprinting, cookie consent, cookies, profiling, user studies in tracking, tracking in mobile, ad blocking, regulation compliance, JavaScript tracking, browser extension fingerprinting, advertising and tracking detection, and privacy.
%
We will make the thematic organization of papers public upon acceptance.
%
We used our domain expertise to structure the SoK around these prominent themes as outlined in the rest of this paper.

Overall, we first provide some background to explain key concepts related to web tracking (\autoref{sec:background}). 
%
Next, we present a unified threat model of web tracking in \autoref{sec:threat-model}. Sections \ref{sec:stateful-tracking} and \ref{sec:stateless-tracking} discuss evolution of stateful and stateless tracking, respectively. 
%
This is followed by a discussion related to cross-device tracking (\autoref{sec:cross-device}) and measurement methodologies used in web tracking studies (\autoref{sec:measurement-methodologies}). 
%
Next, in \autoref{sec:regulations} we compare the evolution of privacy regulations in US vs. EU. 
%
Finally, in \autoref{sec:future-outlook}, we explore future research directions by identifying key open problems that the research community should focus on.
